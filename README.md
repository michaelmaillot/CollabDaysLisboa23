## Prerequisites

### Run tests with Playwright

In order to run your tests locally & remotely, both with the VS Code extension and the CLI (local & through GitHub Actions), you need to configure environment variables.

#### For the VS Code extension

You need to add the following settings in the `.vscode/settings.json` file:

```json
"playwright.env": {
    "M365_LOGIN": "",
    "M365_PWD": ""
  }
```

#### For the CLI

You need to add a `.env` file at the root of your project, which will contain following parameters:

```
M365_LOGIN=''
M365_PWD=''
PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_ACCESS_TOKEN=''
PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_URL=''
```

#### GitHub Actions

Go to **Settings**, then **Secrets** and add the following *repository secrets*:

* M365_LOGIN
* M365_PWD

If you plan to use Microsoft Playwright, add:

* PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_ACCESS_TOKEN
* PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_URL
* PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_RUN_ID

If you plan to publish Playwright reports on Azure, add:

* AZCOPY_SPA_APPLICATION_ID
* AZCOPY_SPA_CLIENT_SECRET
* AZCOPY_TENANT_ID

### Context testing authentication

To ensure that your tests will work in a real context, you need to be authenticated. So you need to provide an account in the environment variables (and the GitHub Action secrets). But this account must be out of the common user security rules, such as MFA. You can configure this one (you or with your Ops) to be secured anyway. For example, you can scope its location to the same region as the pipeline will run in order not to trigger geographic alert.

### Teams personal apps

Authenticate to [Teams Admin Portal](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com) in order to enable personal apps.

## Minimal Path to Awesome

- Clone this repository
- Ensure that you are at the solution folder
- in the command-line run:
  - **npm install**

- Enable the deployment on the whole tenant and sync it to Teams
- Authenticate to Microsoft 365 with the account configured in the environment variable
- Add the app called **Hello M365** in Teams, Outlook and Microsoft 365 portal
- In the `tests\m365app.spec.ts`, configure the following constant:
  - **APP_ID**: the Teams personnal app ID (you can find it on the Teams manifest file if you've generated one once deployed on Teams if auto-generated)

Once environment variables created and configured, you can run the following commands:

`npx playwright test`
